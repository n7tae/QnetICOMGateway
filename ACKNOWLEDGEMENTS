QnetGateway started as g2_ircddb written by Scott Lawson, KI4LKF. Many of Scott's original comments are contained
in the this package.

QnetGateway uses IRCDDB software written by Michael Dirska, DL1BFF. Both Scott and Michael published their code under
version 2 of the GNU General Public License. The current form of QnetGateway would be completely impossible without
Scott and Michael's contribution. Thank you for a great starting point of this current project!

Some parts of are also inspired from ircDDBGateway by Jonathan Naylor, G4KLX and his copyright appears in those files
that used his ideas. The TCPReaderWriterClient is copied in whole. Thanks Jonathan!
